Timetable scheduling (TS) is a famous problem where you are trying to come up with a weekly 
timetable for classes in a faculty. Classes must be arranged so that there are no clashes among
them. Here, the task is to search for the optimum timetable schedule. A possible definition for 
the problem is: Given a set of lecturers (Professors), a set of courses on individual topics and a 
Course Requirements matrix with integer elements representing the number of hours a lecturer 
teaches a course during each week, the problem is to allocate times to these hours so that a 
student may take as many suitable combinations of courses as possible. Or, simply to create a 
practical timetable for a whole faculty in which courses offered by different departments may be 
combined in various ways to suit individual students. Typically there are a set of hard constraints 
which must be fulfilled (if violated, the schedule is invalid), and a set of soft constraints which 
define the relative quality of valid solutions (desirable to satisfy them, but not meeting them 
doesnâ€™t make the schedule invalid).
